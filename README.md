## The problem:

- Due to COVID, restaurants stayed closed for a long time. Still, people feel insecure in a restaurant, and checking the menu card is one of them.
- Some restaurants don't have a website to show the hotel menu card, peoples need to call and ask if they want parcel or home delivery.
- This caused a lot of peoples inconvenience whos are a bachelor or have a habit of getting food from outside on regular basis.

## How it solves:

We have designed a simple web and android app using which restaurant can create a digital menu and also share it via a link or QR code.

**Restaurant Side:** Restaurants can use our app and create a menu just by adding a simple list (it has very minimal UI) and after creating a menu users can share a QR code of their menu and or a link.

**Customer Side:** On Customer Side, they can scan QR code on the web and get access to the menu. (User can scan QR on our Web App also).
